# Jexxa - A Ports and Adapters Framework or Java 

Jexxa is a lightweight micro-framework to support implementing business applications based on a [ports and adapters](https://www.thinktocode.com/2018/07/19/ports-and-adapters-architecture/) architecture. 

Goal of this framework is to easily connect and exchange technology stacks, so called adapters, to ports of a technology agnostic business application. 

Up to now the framework provides following features:

* Utility classes to scan the inbound ports of an application core and bind it to available driving adapter. 

* Implementation of different driving adapters such as REST using available micro-frameworks.
