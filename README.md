# Jexxa

Jexxa is a lightweight micro-framework     supporting implementation of applications based on a [ports and adapters](https://www.thinktocode.com/2018/07/19/ports-and-adapters-architecture/) architecture. 

Goal of this framework is to easily connect available micro-frameworks to an technology agnostic application core in terms of Domain-Driven Design(DDD). 

Up to now the framework provides following features:

* Implementation of different driving adapters such as REST, JMS, or JMX using available micro-frameworks 

* Utility classes to scan the inbound ports of an application core and bind it to available driving adapter.
