# Jexxa - A Ports and Adapters Framework for Java 

Jexxa is a lightweight framework to implement business applications based on a [ports and adapters](https://www.thinktocode.com/2018/07/19/ports-and-adapters-architecture/) architecture. 

Goal of this framework is to easily connect and exchange technology stacks, called adapters, to interfaces of a technology agnostic business application, called ports. 

Up to now the framework provides following features:
 

* Binding required driving adapters to inbound ports of your application. 

* Dependency injection of driven adapters into your application core without any framework specific annotations. 

* Integration of different driving adapters based on available micro-frameworks.
