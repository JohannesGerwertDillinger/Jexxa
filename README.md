# Jexxa - A Ports and Adapters Framework for Java 

Jexxa is a lightweight micro-framework to support implementing business applications based on a [ports and adapters](https://www.thinktocode.com/2018/07/19/ports-and-adapters-architecture/) architecture. 

Goal of this framework is to easily connect and exchange technology stacks, so called adapters, to ports of a technology agnostic business application. At the moment this project is only used for educational purposes and not used in production ready applications.   

Up to now the framework provides following features:

* Factories for ports of an application core and bind it to available driving adapter. 

* Implementation of different driving adapters such as JMX and RESTfulRPC.
