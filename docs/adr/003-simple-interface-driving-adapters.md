# 3. Simple Interface for Driving Adapters

Date: 2021-12-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context
One of the key aspects for durable software systems is the ability to use arbitrary technology stacks which do not exist 
at the point in time the application was developed. Jexxa provides a super simple API that allows for the integration of 
arbitrary technology stacks as driving adapters. 

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

Students can support your teams with the evaluation and integration of new technology stacks as part of their bachelor or master thesis.

The possibility to bind driving adapter on an object level allows for the integration and migration of dedicated technology stacks.
